<td><p> One method of breaking a symmetric algorithm is to simply try every key within the full algorithm until the right key is found. For public key algorithms, since half of the key pair is publicly known, the other half (private key) can be derived using published, though complex, mathematical calculations. Manually finding the key to break an algorithm is called a brute force attack.
Breaking an algorithm introduces the risk of intercepting, or even impersonating and fraudulently verifying, private information.
The key strength of an algorithm is determined by finding the fastest method to break the algorithm and comparing it to a brute force attack.
For symmetric keys, encryption strength is often described in terms of the size or length of the keys used to perform the encryption: in general, longer keys provide stronger encryption. Key length is measured in bits. For example, 128-bit keys for use with the RC4 symmetric-key cipher supported by SSL provide significantly better cryptographic protection than 40-bit keys for use with the same cipher. Roughly speaking, 128-bit RC4 encryption is 3 x 1026 times stronger than 40-bit RC4 encryption. (For more information about RC4 and other ciphers used with SSL, see "Introduction to SSL.") An encryption key is considered full strength if the best known attack to break the key is no faster than a brute force attempt to test every key possibility.
Different ciphers may require different key lengths to achieve the same level of encryption strength. The RSA cipher used for public-key encryption, for example, can use only a subset of all possible values for a key of a given length, due to the nature of the mathematical problem on which it is based. Other ciphers, such as those used for symmetric key encryption, can use all possible values for a key of a given length, rather than a subset of those values.
Because it is relatively trivial to break an RSA key, an RSA public-key encryption cipher must have a very long key, at least 1024 bits, to be considered cryptographically strong. On the other hand, symmetric-key ciphers can achieve approximately the same level of strength with an 80-bit key for most algorithms.
